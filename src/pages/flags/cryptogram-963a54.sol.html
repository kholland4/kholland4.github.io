        This is a simple alphabetical substitution cipher.
        Each letter in the English alphabet is replaced with a different letter.
        Since the ciphertext is fairly long, it's susceptible to several forms
        of statistical analysis.
        Letters don't appear with consistent frequency: the letter "e" makes up
        about 13% of all English text, followed by "t" (9.1%) and "a" (8.2%).
        Automated tools are available to use this analysis (possibly in
        combination with a dictionary to detect whole words) to break a
        simple substitution cipher.

In set theory, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, named after mathematicians Ernst
Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel, is an axiomatic system that was proposed in the
early twentieth century in order to formulate a theory of sets free of paradoxes
such as Russell's paradox. Today, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, with the
historically controversial axiom of choice (AC) included, is the standard form
of axiomatic set theory and as such is the most common foundation of
mathematics. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice included is
abbreviated ZFC, where C stands for "choice", and ZF refers to the axioms of
Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice excluded.
